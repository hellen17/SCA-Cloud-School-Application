Technical assesment for SCA Cloud Bootcamp application

Source(git) - Using the git plugin I connected the github repo to Jenkins and automatically initiate a build anytime a new commit is made
Build/package - In the Jenkinsfile, I created a stage called 'build' where I execute my python file
Deploy - In the deploy stage one can define the steps needed to deploy their work to a server
